# Tracking Depressive Symptom Rates in America:  Insights from COVID-19 Survey Data

This project was a Senior year Data Science Capstone project that I completed for the classes of STAT 4915 and 4916W.

## Abstract

Globally, depression is a leading cause of disability and is widely believed to have been exacerbated by the social, economic, and health-related stresses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from the CDC’s Household Pulse Survey, this study examines reported depression symptom rates among U.S. adults from May 2020 to August 2024. The survey’s goal was to explore differences across demographic groups and geographic regions in order to better understand COVID-19’s impact socially and economically on different populations. This analysis uses non-parametric statistical tests to identify if there are differences in depressive symptoms within each subgroup. Additionally, time-series plots were created to track trends over time, and heat maps were developed to highlight variations across states. Results showed that younger adults (ages 18–29), females, individuals with lower levels of education, and certain racial and ethnic groups consistently reported higher rates of depressive symptoms compared to national averages. Statistical testing confirmed that many of these differences between subgroups were significant. Further, this analysis compares its findings to previous literature to gain understanding on how the symptom patterns observed differ or align from established trends. It should be carefully noted that the relationships identified in this analysis are observational and should not be interpreted as causal.
